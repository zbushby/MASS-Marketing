# MASS-Marketing
To future committee reading this,

Here is my code for sending out the emails for the newsletter, welcome emails, raffle tickets (attendance), and cleaning/sorting CSV files etc. also, some code to work out who bought member tickets and who aren't members :/

I have written the newsletters in HTML and stuck with the same format so it should be quick to edit stuff. For images make sure to use a direct image link of a Google Drive share link with public sharing turned on.

For all email sending, you can't use Zoho as it doesn't give app passwords. I have set it up for Gmail emails so all you need to change is the email and app password. Also, don't remove the 3-second sleep timer, if you do and you send all emails at once you get locked out of your Gmail account because Google thinks you got hacked :(


I have a lot of CSV files of info on past/present members that I haven't added to this repo for privacy reasons so if you need it let me know.


If you have any questions feel free to message me :)

Good Luck with MASS
